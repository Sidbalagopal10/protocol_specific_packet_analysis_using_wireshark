Communication Overview:

Client IP: 10.0.2.15
DNS Server IP: 192.168.29.1
Communication consists of multiple standard DNS queries and responses.
  
Domain Resolution Activity:
The following domains were requested for resolution:
contile.services.mozilla.com
r11.o.lencr.org (Let's Encrypt-related)
content-signature-2.cdn.mozilla.net
content-signature-chains.prod.autograph.services.mozaws
ipv4only.arpa
example.org
                 
Notable DNS Record Types:
AAAA Records: IPv6 address lookups.
CNAME Records: Domain aliases identified.
A Records: Some responses provide IPv4 addresses (e.g., 34.117.188.166).
AWS Domains: AWS-hosted domains (e.g., awsdns-20.net).
Akamai Domains: Content delivery infrastructure (e.g., akamai.net).
                 
Pattern Observed:
Query Type: Mostly "Standard query."
Response Size: Varies between ~70 to ~260 bytes.
Process: Appears as a systematic DNS resolution pattern typical of a browser (e.g., Firefox) startup, resolving Mozilla services and associated domains.
                 
Summary:
This capture likely reflects standard, legitimate DNS resolution traffic, with connections to Mozilla and Let's Encrypt services typically triggered during browser startup.
