OCSP Requests and Responses:

OCSP Protocol is used for checking the status of SSL/TLS certificates to ensure they are still valid. In this screenshot, you can see multiple OCSP requests and responses, indicating that a device is validating certificates.
The traffic flow between source IP 10.0.2.15 and destination IP 49.44.194.83 involves several OCSP requests and responses, which suggests that the client is verifying certificate validity from a Certificate Authority (CA) server.


HTTP Traffic:

There are two HTTP GET requests with the resource /success.txt followed by a query parameter (ipv4). This type of request to check for /success.txt is sometimes used by systems or services as a simple connectivity check, possibly to confirm internet connectivity or service availability.
The HTTP response code 200 OK shows that the server responded successfully with a plain text file. This could indicate normal communication or a benign connectivity verification check.
Conclusion on Traffic Patterns:

The combination of OCSP requests with simple HTTP GET requests suggests this traffic may be related to a legitimate application or service performing connectivity checks while verifying the validity of SSL/TLS certificates.
No apparent anomalies are visible in this screenshot, as OCSP checks and basic HTTP GET requests to /success.txt are common for verifying server reachability and certificate status.
This traffic appears typical of background connectivity checks, with no obvious signs of malicious activity based on the information shown.
